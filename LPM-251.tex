\setDocAbstract {
This document describes the proposed policies for groups that are independent from the LSST Project and Operating Facility and would like to stand up an independent Data Access Center (iDAC). Some iDAC may want to serve only a subset of the LSST data products: this document proposes three portion sizes, from full releases to a "light" catalog without posteriors. Guidelines and requirements for iDACs in terms of data storage, computational resources, dedicated personnel, and user authentication are described, as well as a preliminary assessment of the cost impacts. {\bf The purpose of this draft document is to serve as a {\it preliminary} resource for partner institutions wishing to assess the feasibility of hosting an iDAC, and is subject to change.}
