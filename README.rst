LDM-251
=======

This document describes the proposed policies for groups that are independent from the LSST Project and Operations (i.e. LSST Data Facility) and would like to stand up an independent Data Access Center (iDAC; existing data centers that could serve LSST data products are considered iDACs for purposes of this document).
