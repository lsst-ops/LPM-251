All access to LSST proprietary data products will be through a Data Access Center (DAC). The United States's DAC will be hosted at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), where authorized LSST users with data rights and data access privileges will perform scientific queries and analysis on the full data releases using the LSST Science Platform (LSP). The LSP is now well documented with the vision given in \citeds{LSE-319}, with more formal requirements in \citeds{LDM-554} and the design in \citeds{LDM-542}. The Chilean DAC will be equivalent in functionality to the US DAC, but scaled-down in terms of the computational resources available for query and analysis given the smaller Chilean community \citedsp{LDM-572}.

All access to, and use of, the LSST proprietary data and data products is subject to the policies described in \citeds{LPM-261}.

This document proposes a set of guidelines and policies for partner institutions -- in the US, Chile, or one of the International Contributors with signed Memoranda of Agreement -- that are interested in hosting the LSST data, in whole or in part, for their affiliated members as an independent Data Access Center (iDAC). The following sections include the types of data products that could be hosted (Section \ref{sec:data}), the requirements and responsibilities that would be expected of an iDAC hosting LSST proprietary data products (Section \ref{sec:reqs}), and a description of the main costs {\it vs.} their science impacts (Section \ref{sec:costs}).

The contents of this draft are meant to provide a preliminary resource for partner institutions who may be assessing the feasibility of hosting an iDAC. The specific mechanisms and processes by which future iDACs will negotiate the bulk transfer of data, the installation of software, etc. is considered beyond the scope of this document.
