% It remains an open question whether {\em any} qualified user from any LSST partner institution can log into any iDAC -- this would facilitate collaboration but would also require that iDACs participate in the single authentication system.

\subsection{iDACs Serving Post-Proprietary Data}
% {\bf MLG: can we think of any requirements/guidelines for this scenario? Should this document even cover non-partner iDACs? Any non-partner iDAC wishing to serve the two-year-old post-proprietary full release to its users would not, for example, be able to get help installing the LSP. Perhaps we could use this paragraph to further encourage the benefits of partnership.}
